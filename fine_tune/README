Explain quantum computing in simple terms.
As you've probably already guessed from its name, quantum computing is a relatively young form of computing that uses quantum physics and properties to perform calculations that are too complex for classical computers, such as arithmetic or logical operations. It uses quantum physics principles like entanglement to perform computations that would be otherwise

How does a car engine work?
A Car Engine works by using an electric motor and gear transmission to convert mechanical energy to electrical energy. The electric motor drives the gear transmission, which is in turn driven by the crankshaft. The crankshaft has rocker arms, which have a number of gears. When the
